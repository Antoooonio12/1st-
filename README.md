### by Antooonio, 2025-05-14

**Hi everyone, IÂ´m new to Github. Just a young student that loves coding and tech righ here!**
_This is **only** an initial test._ 
To run this test, you need to have Python installed in your PC. You can download it from its official web: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Soon
In some days, I'll receive an _Arduino Kit_. Obviously, I'll post a new repo with all my projects, so consider reviewing it. 

## Contact
If you want to contact me, please use my email: tonperezalb@gmail.com. There you can suggest me anything you want.
My goal is to learn a lot, so I'll apreciate it.
